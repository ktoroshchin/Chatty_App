# Chatty App

Chatty App allow users to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It uses React, as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel.

## Behaviour

* When any connected user sends a chat message, all connected users receive and display the message.

* When any connected user changes their name, all connected users are notified of the name change.


* Notifications are styled differently from chat messages
* Header will display the count of connected users

* When the number of connected users changes, this count will be updated for all connected users.
* Different users names will each be colored differently
